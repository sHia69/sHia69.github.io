          <p>
            Hello, my name is Hia, but its actual pronunciation is Haya. 
            You could have wondered, how did it change to Hia; it is because I was in Germany, and they didn't have this name. 
            So, you can see that it is Hia, but my preference is Haya because it is my real one. My pronouns are she/her. 
            I speak three fluent languages: Turkmen, Arabic, and Turkish. I have learned English in Canada, and I can speak four languages. 
            I am also learning Korean and Spanish.   I live in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. In my family, there are three sisters and one brother. 
            Since my family had always made me the middle child, I would find a balance in or between my siblings. 
            Currently, I am attending St. Clair College as a first-year Computer Programming student. 
            It all started in high school, really, where I learned tons about different coding languages, various tools, and generally about tech stuff. 
            I really like coding because it offers challenges while building something new. My goal is to be continuously better and work on software that may do some real good. 
            I would be glad to share more about my interests and experiences with you!
