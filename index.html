                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Hia, but its actual pronunciation is Haya.
                    You could have wondered, how did it change to Hia; it is
                    because I was in Germany, and they didn't have this name.
                    So, you can see that it is Hia, but my preference is Haya
                    because it is my real one. My pronouns are she/her. I speak
                    three fluent languages: Turkmen, Arabic, and Turkish. I have
                    learned English in Canada, and I can speak four languages. I
                    am also learning Korean and Spanish.
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            I live in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. In my family,
                            there are three sisters and one brother. Since my
                            family had always made me the middle child, I would
                            find a balance in or between my siblings.
                            Currently, I am attending St. Clair College as a
                            first-year Computer Programming student. It all
                            started in high school, really, where I learned tons
                            about different coding languages, various tools, and
                            generally about tech stuff. I really like coding
                            because it offers challenges while building
                            something new. My goal is to be continuously better
                            and work on software that may do some real good.
                            I would be glad to share more about my interests and
                            experiences with you!

                    <p>I was born to travel and learn in different places. One
                        of the longest experiences in my life was high school,
                        where I attended four different schools to complete my
                        education.</p>

                            If I could meet one person on this planet, I would
                            choose to meet the famous mathematician, <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles">Andrew
                                Wiles</a>.
                            He is known for proving Fermat's Last Theorem, a
                            problem that had remained unsolved for over 350
                            years. I would love to discuss his journey and the
                            challenges he faced while working on this theorem.
